A simple VQA model made just for learning and researching with new techniques.

---

As of now this model knows stuff, like it knows what all question questions and what all images are what-what, but accuracy not so great yet. 

when there is more stable model with good accuracy I will attach link to the model file. As of now this is very basic implementation
### Run Sample Inference

```bash
python Model.py
